> A feature-complete general-purpose OAuth2 client built using Redwood.

## Providers available

Coinbase, Twitch, Chess.com, Plaid, and a demo self-hosted provider called "keyp" ([pi0neerpat/oauth2-demo-server](https://github.com/pi0neerpat/oauth2-demo-server)).

To add any new provider, simply create a new file in the providers directory.

## Features

- Server-side token exchange, refreshing, and revoking
- Web-side redirection handling
- Any provider can also serve as a login method using "wrapped dbAuth" (as first introduced in the community forum post [Combining dbAuth + OAuth2](https://community.redwoodjs.com/t/combining-dbauth-oauth2/2452/8))
- No 3rd-party services required, and only one external dependency (pkce-challenge)

## Demo üìô

https://oauth2-client-redwood.vercel.app

## Implement in your app

NOTE: if you're not using a provider for logins, you can skip to step 4.

1. Setup dbAuth

```bash
yarn setup auth dbAuth
```

No need to follow the all instructions there, instead you will update the graphql schema as defined in step 3.

Also, create the session secret in your `.env` using `yarn rw g secret`

```
SESSION_SECRET=abc123
```

2. Install necessary dependencies

```bash
 cd api && yarn add pkce-challenge
```

3. Update the schema as necessary

```graphql
model User {
  id           String   @id
  username     String?  @unique
  address      String?  @unique
  email        String?  @unique
  // --------------- STATE --------------
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime @updatedAt
  refreshToken String?
  accessToken  String?
  OAuth        OAuth[]
  betaAccess   Boolean  @default(false)
}

model OAuth {
  state         String   @id
  codeChallenge String
  codeVerifier  String
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  user          User?    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId        String?
}
```

4. Modify the provider files

This is where you'll decide what you want to happen once a user is connected to the provider. For example, you may want to create a new user in your database, or you may want to update an existing user with new data from the provider (eg. a Twitch username).

A few notes on the current example providers, and the use-cases they are meant to serve. All of these can be changed easily to fit your needs.

- **Coinbase**: Grab the user's ethereum address so you can send them crypto.
- **Twitch**: Grab the user's Twitch username.
- **Chess.com**: Used as a login provider, but you could easily modify it to just grab user data.
- **Plaid**: Their OAuth2 implementation requires some additional code which I've intentially excluded to keep things here clean + simple. I don't recommend using this as a template for new providers. Also, Plaid is an evil company and you should try to avoid using them.
## Next steps

- [ ] Add more providers (your help needed!)
- [ ] Create a developer dashboard for generating new API OAuth client credentials, using RedwoodJS. This is tangentially related, but we are planning to build it anyways, so I thought I'd mention it here.
